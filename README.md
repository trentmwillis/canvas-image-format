# Canvas Image Format

A small, proof-of-concept application for the ability to polyfill new image formats entirely in JavaScript! Made possible by [`Service Workers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) and leverages [`Streams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) and [`OffscreenCanvas`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas).

_Note: `OffscreenCanvas` currently requires a flag to be used in Chrome._
